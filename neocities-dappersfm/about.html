      <h1>An Artist's Journey:</h1>
        <h2>2021-22</h2>
        <p>I started drawing seriously around 2021, where I drew things I don't wanna talk about. After this point I had started my first TikTok, drawing that exact thing. I'm glad I no longer have access to that account. about a year after that, a (now) best friend of mine reccomended me the Webcomic of Homestuck, leading me to create my pride and joy, Marlie Malour about a couple months after that. Also this is around the time I got and broke my first drawing tablet: The Huion Inspiroy. I also created a Tumblr some at some point.

        <div class="col-md my-auto">
          <p>I believe arround this time is when I lost access to my origional TikTok (good riddance). I can't remeber like anything else from 22-23 other than the creation of some new accounts so uhh time skip? This is the point I think my art is nearing what I make today, just shittier of course. example included:</p>
